# Other landmarking methods

One of the primary uses for AAMs is to obtain a set of landmarks on an image. In
this it is related to a whole host of other methods to do the same. [@wuji2019a]
categorises these into: Constrained Local Models, regression based methods, and
holistic methods, which is their term for AAMs.

Constrained Local Models (CLMs) use a point distribution model like in AAMs,
that they use to constrain landmark positions obtained from a set of local
models. They vary based on what techniques are used for the local models, and
how the local model outputs are used to obtain the shape.

Add details of:

- *Regularised Landmark Mean Shift (RLMS)* [@saragLuceyEtAl2011a].
- *Constrained Local Neural Fields (CLNF)* [@baltrRobinEtAl2013a].

Regression based methods may use local or global models, fitting only on local
context or the whole image) but they do not make use of a PDM or similar to
explicitly model the shape of the face.
