## Landmarking configurations

*consider moving or rewriting this*

Before going deeper into methods of computing landmarks, I shall talk briefly
about landmark configurations. Different landmarking schemes exist, with varying
numbers of landmarks and with the landmarks localised to different parts of the
face [@sagonAntonEtAl2016a]. The different configurations have arisen from the
different decisions made by people collecting and annotating datasets, and
appear to be mostly arbitrary. One of the most widely used is the 68 point
configuration from the Multi-PIE dataset (which is the one shown in
[@fig:landmarkExample]). Thanks to the work done for the 300 Faces In-The-Wild
challenge [@sagonAntonEtAl2016a], there are now annotations using the 68 point
configuration available for several public datasets.
