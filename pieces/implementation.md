# Implementation

To implement the experiments Python and the `menpo`/`menpofit` packages were
used. The AAMs were trained on the LFPW and IBUG datasets, and test on the 300w
challenge dataset.

The selection of Python was driven by the availability of the `menpo` packages.
`menpo` and `menpofit` are Python packages that implement a framework for
deformable object modelling, including extensible AAM classes.
