Datasets:

- The PASCAL Object Recognition Database Collection. Among other classes
includes images of people

- [FairFace](https://github.com/joojs/fairface)


Refinement to goal:

Test successful algorithms against datasets emphasising a better balance of
characteristics such as race, gender and age, especially if the original
authors of the algorithm used a heavily biased dataset.

Languages/tools:

- Given a choice, I'll probably use Python for the language. It's well
supported for the use case, and I know it well.

- For tools, PyTorch seems to be a good place to start.
