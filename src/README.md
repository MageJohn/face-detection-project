This is the code used for collecting data in the project. I've done my best, but can't guarantee that everything will work correctly as is. 

Requires Python 3 (tested with 3.10).

To run the code, follow these steps:

- Set up a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`, then activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`.
- Install the package in editable mode: `pip install -e .`. This should install the necessary dependencies, including my modified `menpo` package from <https://github.com/MageJohn/menpo>.
- Run `experiments --help` to test that the entry script was installed correctly.
