    Face detection is a crucial task in multistage computer vision systems. This
    paper establishes an effort to summarize the face detection algorithms
    published in the field. Survey and review papers are always very helpful for
    both new and experienced researchers equally. Such surveys enable new
    researchers to dive deeply into the field and grasp gist of algorithms,
    while experienced researchers can easily track advancements in a specific
    area. Therefore, survey papers have an important role of contribution in the
    field. This article points out and summarizes the algorithms in which
    feature extraction techniques and back end machine learning classifiers have
    been investigated. The algorithms are compared quantitatively and
    qualitatively.

    Facial feature detection algorithms have seen great progress over the recent
    years. However, they still struggle in poor lighting conditions and in the
    presence of extreme pose or occlusions. We present the Constrained Local
    Neural Field model for facial landmark detection. Our model includes two
    main novelties. First, we introduce a probabilistic patch expert (landmark
    detector) that can learn non-linear and spatial relationships between the
    input pixels and the probability of a landmark being aligned. Secondly, our
    model is optimised using a novel Non-uniform Regularised Landmark Mean-Shift
    optimisation technique, which takes into account the reliabilities of each
    patch expert. We demonstrate the beneﬁt of our approach on a number of
    publicly available datasets over other state-of-the-art approaches when
    performing landmark detection in unseen lighting conditions and in the wild.

    Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in automatic
    facial behavior analysis and understanding. We present OpenFace 2.0 — a tool
    intended for computer vision and machine learning researchers, affective
    computing community and people interested in building interactive
    applications based on facial behavior analysis. OpenFace 2.0 is an extension
    of OpenFace toolkit (created by Baltrusˇaitis et al. [11]) and is capable of
    more accurate facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, facial action
    unit recognition, and eye-gaze estimation. The computer vision algorithms
    which represent the core of OpenFace 2.0 demonstrate state-of-theart results
    in all of the above mentioned tasks. Furthermore, our tool is capable of
    real-time performance and is able to run from a simple webcam without any
    specialist hardware. Finally, unlike a lot of modern approaches or toolkits,
    OpenFace 2.0 source code for training models and running them is freely
    available for research purposes.

    Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate
    based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach
    to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and
    datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist 
    approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the
    gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A
    and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of
    lighter-skinned subjects (79.6% for IJB-A and 86.2% for Adience) and
    introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin
    type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our
    dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified
    group (with error rates of up to 34.7%). The maximum error rate for
    lighter-skinned males is 0.8%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy
    of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter
    males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if
    commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and
    accountable facial analysis algorithms.

    We describe a new method of matching statistical models of appearance to
    images. A set of model parameters control modes of shape and gray-level
    variation learned from a training set. We construct an efficient iterative
    matching algorithm by learning the relationship between perturbations in the
    model parameters and the induced image errors.

    Although facial feature detection from 2D images is a well-studied field,
    there is a lack of real-time methods that estimate feature points even on
    low quality images. Here we propose conditional regression forest for this
    task. While regression forest learn the relations between facial image
    patches and the location of feature points from the entire set of faces,
    conditional regression forest learn the relations conditional to global face
    properties. In our experiments, we use the head pose as a global property
    and demonstrate that conditional regression forests outperform regression
    forests for facial feature detection. We have evaluated the method on the
    challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild [20] database where close-to-human
    accuracy is achieved while processing images in real-time.

    In this article, we present the Menpo 2D and Menpo 3D benchmarks, two new
    datasets for multi-pose 2D and 3D facial landmark localisation and tracking.
    In contrast to the previous benchmarks such as 300W and 300VW, the proposed
    benchmarks contain facial images in both semi-frontal and profile pose. We
    introduce an elaborate semi-automatic methodology for providing high-quality
    annotations for both the Menpo 2D and Menpo 3D benchmarks. In Menpo 2D
    benchmark, different visible landmark configurations are designed for
    semi-frontal and profile faces, thus making the 2D face alignment full-pose.
    In Menpo 3D benchmark, a united landmark configuration is designed for both
    semi-frontal and profile faces based on the correspondence with a 3D face
    model, thus making face alignment not only full-pose but also corresponding
    to the real-world 3D space. Based on the considerable number of annotated
    images, we organised Menpo 2D Challenge and Menpo 3D Challenge for face
    alignment under large pose variations in conjunction with CVPR 2017 and ICCV
    2017, respectively. The results of these challenges demonstrate that recent
    deep learning architectures, when trained with the abundant data, lead to
    excellent results. We also provide a very simple, yet effective solution,
    named Cascade Multi-view Hourglass Model, to 2D and 3D face alignment. In
    our method, we take advantage of all 2D and 3D facial landmark annotations
    in a joint way. We not only capitalise on the correspondences between the
    semi-frontal and profile 2D facial landmarks but also employ joint
    supervision from both 2D and 3D facial landmarks. Finally, we discuss future
    directions on the topic of face alignment.

  abstract: "The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two components: (i)\_a publicly available dataset of images together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii)\_an annual competition and workshop. There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008–2012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community’s progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges."

    In many decision-making scenarios, ranging from recreational activities to
    healthcare and policing, the use of artificial intelligence coupled with the
    ability to learn from historical data is becoming ubiquitous. This
    widespread adoption of automated systems is accompanied by the increasing
    concerns regarding their ethical implications. Fundamental rights, such as
    the ones that require the preservation of privacy, do not discriminate based
    on sensible attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity, political/sexual
    orientation), or require one to provide an explanation for a decision, are
    daily undermined by the use of increasingly complex and less understandable
    yet more accurate learning algorithms. For this purpose, in this work, we
    work toward the development of systems able to ensure trustworthiness by
    delivering privacy, fairness, and explainability by design. In particular,
    we show that it is possible to simultaneously learn from data while
    preserving the privacy of the individuals thanks to the use of Homomorphic
    Encryption, ensuring fairness by learning a fair representation from the
    data, and ensuring explainable decisions with local and global explanations
    without compromising the accuracy of the final models. We test our approach
    on a widespread but still controversial application, namely face
    recognition, using the recent FairFace dataset to prove the validity of our
    approach.

    SupposePi(i)(i = 1, 2, ...,m, j = 1, 2, ...,n) give the locations ofmn
    points inp-dimensional space. Collectively these may be regarded asm
    configurations, or scalings, each ofn points inp-dimensions. The problem is
    investigated of translating, rotating, reflecting and scaling them
    configurations to minimize the goodness-of-fit criterion
    Σi=1mΣi=1nΔ2(Pj(i)Gi), whereGiis the centroid of them pointsPi(i)(i = 1, 2,
    ...,m). The rotated positions of each configuration may be regarded as
    individual analyses with the centroid configuration representing a
    consensus, and this relationship with individual scaling analysis is
    discussed. A computational technique is given, the results of which can be
    summarized in analysis of variance form. The special casem = 2 corresponds
    to Classical Procrustes analysis but the choice of criterion that fits each
    configuration to the common centroid configuration avoids difficulties that
    arise when one set is fitted to the other, regarded as fixed.

    A close relationship exists between the advancement of face recognition
    algorithms and the availability of face databases varying factors that
    affect facial appearance in a controlled manner. The CMU PIE database has
    been very influential in advancing research in face recognition across pose
    and illumination. Despite its success the PIE database has several
    shortcomings: a limited number of subjects, single recording session and
    only few expressions captured. To address these issues we collected the CMU
    Multi-PIE database. It contains 337 subjects, imaged under 15 view points
    and 19 illumination conditions in up to four recording sessions. In this
    paper we introduce the database and describe the recording procedure. We
    furthermore present results from baseline experiments using PCA and LDA
    classifiers to highlight similarities and differences between PIE and
    Multi-PIE.

    Efﬁcient detection of objects in images is complicated by variations of
    object appearance due to intra-class object differences, articulation,
    lighting, occlusions, and aspect variations. To reduce the search required
    for detection, we employ the bottom-up approach where we ﬁnd candidate image
    features and associate some of them with parts of the object model. We
    represent objects as collections of local features, and would like to allow
    any of them to be absent, with only a small subset sufﬁcient for detection;
    furthermore, our model should allow efﬁcient correspondence search. We
    propose a model, Mixture of Trees, that achieves these goals. With a mixture
    of trees, we can model the individual appearances of the features,
    relationships among them, and the aspect, and handle occlusions.
    Independences captured in the model make efﬁcient inference possible. In our
    earlier work, we have shown that mixtures of trees can be used to model
    objects with a natural tree structure, in the context of human tracking. Now
    we show that a natural tree structure is not required, and use a mixture of
    trees for both frontal and view-invariant face detection. We also show that
    by modeling faces as collections of features we can establish an intrinsic

    Face detection is the task of detecting faces on photos, videos as well as
    the streaming data such as a webcam. Face detection, which is a specific
    type of general-purpose object detection, is a key prerequisite for many
    other artificial intelligence tasks such as face verification, face tagging
    and retrieval, and face tracking. In addition to that, nowadays, face
    detection is commonly used in daily routines such as social media, and
    camera software of smartphones. As a result of this necessity, several face
    detection tools have been proposed. In this study, an experimental
    performance comparison of well-known face detection tools in terms of (1)
    accuracy, and (2) elapsed time of detection, which has become even more
    critical criteria especially when the face detection mechanism is utilized
    for a real-time system, is proposed. As a result of this experimental study,
    it is aimed that shed light on the much-concerned query “which face
    detection tool provides the best performance?”. In addition to that, this
    study succeeds in showing that convolutional neural networks achieve great
    accuracy for face detection.

    Existing public face datasets are strongly biased toward Caucasian faces,
    and other races (e.g., Latino) are significantly underrepresented. This can
    lead to inconsistent model accuracy, limit the applicability of face
    analytic systems to non-White race groups, and adversely affect research
    findings based on such skewed data. To mitigate the race bias in these
    datasets, we construct a novel face image dataset, containing 108,501
    images, with an emphasis of balanced race composition in the dataset. We
    define 7 race groups: White, Black, Indian, East Asian, Southeast Asian,
    Middle East, and Latino. Images were collected from the YFCC-100M Flickr
    dataset and labeled with race, gender, and age groups. Evaluations were
    performed on existing face attribute datasets as well as novel image
    datasets to measure generalization performance. We find that the model
    trained from our dataset is substantially more accurate on novel datasets
    and the accuracy is consistent between race and gender groups.

    This paper addresses the problem of Face Alignment for a single image. We
    show how an ensemble of regression trees can be used to estimate the face's
    landmark positions directly from a sparse subset of pixel intensities,
    achieving super-realtime performance with high quality predictions. We
    present a general framework based on gradient boosting for learning an
    ensemble of regression trees that optimizes the sum of square error loss and
    naturally handles missing or partially labelled data. We show how using
    appropriate priors exploiting the structure of image data helps with
    efficient feature selection. Different regularization strategies and its
    importance to combat overfitting are also investigated. In addition, we
    analyse the effect of the quantity of training data on the accuracy of the
    predictions and explore the effect of data augmentation using synthesized
    data.

    In this paper we survey and analyze modern neural-network-based facial
    landmark detection algorithms. We focus on approaches that have led to a
    significant increase in quality over the past few years on datasets with
    large pose and emotion variability, high levels of face occlusions - all of
    which are typical in real-world scenarios. We summarize the improvements
    into categories, provide quality comparison on difficult and modern
    in-the-wild datasets: 300-W, AFLW, WFLW, COFW. Additionally, we compare
    algorithm speed on CPU, GPU and Mobile devices. For completeness, we also
    briefly touch on established methods with open implementations available.
    Besides, we cover applications and vulnerabilities of the landmark detection
    algorithms. Based on which, we raise problems that as we hope will lead to
    further algorithm improvements.

    There are many excellent toolkits which provide support for developing
    machine learning software in Python, R, Matlab, and similar environments.
    Dlib-ml is an open source library, targeted at both engineers and research
    scientists, which aims to provide a similarly rich environment for
    developing machine learning software in the C++ language. Towards this end,
    dlib-ml contains an extensible linear algebra toolkit with built in BLAS
    support. It also houses implementations of algorithms for performing
    inference in Bayesian networks and kernel-based methods for classification,
    regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and feature ranking. To enable
    easy use of these tools, the entire library has been developed with contract
    programming, which provides complete and precise documentation as well as
    powerful debugging tools.

    Face alignment is a crucial step in face recognition tasks. Especially,
    using landmark localization for geometric face normalization has shown to be
    very effective, clearly improving the recognition results. However, no
    adequate databases exist that provide a sufficient number of annotated
    facial landmarks. The databases are either limited to frontal views, provide
    only a small number of annotated images or have been acquired under
    controlled conditions. Hence, we introduce a novel database overcoming these
    limitations: Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (AFLW). AFLW provides a
    large-scale collection of images gathered from Flickr, exhibiting a large
    variety in face appearance (e.g., pose, expression, ethnicity, age, gender)
    as well as general imaging and environmental conditions. In total 25,993
    faces in 21,997 real-world images are annotated with up to 21 landmarks per
    image. Due to the comprehensive set of annotations AFLW is well suited to
    train and test algorithms for multi-view face detection, facial landmark
    localization and face pose estimation. Further, we offer a rich set of tools
    that ease the integration of other face databases and associated annotations
    into our joint framework.

    We address the problem of interactive facial feature localization from a
    single image. Our goal is to obtain an accurate segmentation of facial
    features on high-resolution images under a variety of pose, expression, and
    lighting conditions. Although there has been significant work in facial
    feature localization, we are addressing a new application area, namely to
    facilitate intelligent high-quality editing of portraits, that brings
    requirements not met by existing methods. We propose an improvement to the
    Active Shape Model that allows for greater independence among the facial
    components and improves on the appearance fitting step by introducing a
    Viterbi optimization process that operates along the facial contours.
    Despite the improvements, we do not expect perfect results in all cases. We
    therefore introduce an interaction model whereby a user can efficiently
    guide the algorithm towards a precise solution. We introduce the Helen
    Facial Feature Dataset consisting of annotated portrait images gathered from
    Flickr that are more diverse and challenging than currently existing
    datasets. We present experiments that compare our automatic method to
    published results, and also a quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness
    of our interactive method.

    We study characteristics of receptive fields of units in deep convolutional
    networks. The receptive field size is a crucial issue in many visual tasks,
    as the output must respond to large enough areas in the image to capture
    information about large objects. We introduce the notion of an effective
    receptive field, and show that it both has a Gaussian distribution and only
    occupies a fraction of the full theoretical receptive field. We analyze the
    effective receptive field in several architecture designs, and the effect of
    nonlinear activations, dropout, sub-sampling and skip connections on it.
    This leads to suggestions for ways to address its tendency to be too small.

    In this chapter we consider the problem of automatic facial expression
    analysis. Our take on this is that the field has reached a point where it
    needs to move away from considering experiments and applications under
    in-the-lab conditions, and move towards so-called in-the-wild scenarios. We
    assume throughout this chapter that the aim is to develop technology that
    can be deployed in practical applications under unconstrained conditions.
    While some first efforts in this direction have been reported very recently,
    it is still unclear what the right path to achieving accurate, informative,
    robust, and real-time facial expression analysis will be. To illuminate the
    journey ahead, we first provide in Sect. 1 an overview of the existing
    theories and specific problem formulations considered within the computer
    vision community. Then we describe in Sect. 2 the standard algorithmic
    pipeline which is common to most facial expression analysis algorithms. We
    include suggestions as to which of the current algorithms and approaches are
    most suited to the scenario considered. In Sect. 3 we describe our view of
    the remaining challenges, and the current opportunities within the field.
    This chapter is thus not intended as a review of different approaches, but
    rather a selection of what we believe are the most suitable state-of-the-art
    algorithms, and a selection of exemplars chosen to characterise a specific
    approach. We review in Sect. 4 some of the exciting opportunities for the
    application of automatic facial expression analysis to everyday practical
    problems and current commercial applications being exploited. Section 5 ends
    the chapter by summarising the major conclusions drawn.

  abstract: >-
    Face recognition is a long standing challenge in the field of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI). The goal is to create systems that accurately detect,
    recognize, verify, and understand human faces. There are significant
    technical hurdles in making these systems accurate, particularly in
    unconstrained settings due to confounding factors related to pose,
    resolution, illumination, occlusion, and viewpoint. However, with recent
    advances in neural networks, face recognition has achieved unprecedented
    accuracy, largely built on data-driven deep learning methods. While this is
    encouraging, a critical aspect that is limiting facial recognition accuracy
    and fairness is inherent facial diversity. Every face is different. Every
    face reflects something unique about us. Aspects of our heritage - including
    race, ethnicity, culture, geography - and our individual identify - age,
    gender, and other visible manifestations of self-expression, are reflected
    in our faces. We expect face recognition to work equally accurately for
    every face. Face recognition needs to be fair. As we rely on data-driven
    methods to create face recognition technology, we need to ensure necessary
    balance and coverage in training data. However, there are still scientific
    questions about how to represent and extract pertinent facial features and
    quantitatively measure facial diversity. Towards this goal, Diversity in
    Faces (DiF) provides a data set of one million annotated human face images
    for advancing the study of facial diversity. The annotations are generated
    using ten well-established facial coding schemes from the scientific
    literature. The facial coding schemes provide human-interpretable
    quantitative measures of facial features. We believe that by making the
    extracted coding schemes available on a large set of faces, we can
    accelerate research and development towards creating more fair and accurate
    facial recognition systems.

    The capacity to estimate the head pose of another person is a common human
    ability that presents a unique challenge for computer vision systems.
    Compared to face detection and recognition, which have been the primary foci
    of face-related vision research, identity-invariant head pose estimation has
    fewer rigorously evaluated systems or generic solutions. In this paper, we
    discuss the inherent difficulties in head pose estimation and present an
    organized survey describing the evolution of the field. Our discussion
    focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and spans 90 of
    the most innovative and characteristic papers that have been published on
    this topic. We compare these systems by focusing on their ability to
    estimate coarse and fine head pose, highlighting approaches that are well
    suited for unconstrained environments.

    Face detection has witnessed immense progress in the last few years, with
    new milestones being surpassed every year. While many challenges such as
    large variations in scale, pose, appearance are successfully addressed,
    there still exist several issues which are not specifically captured by
    existing methods or datasets. In this work, we identify the next set of
    challenges that requires attention from the research community and collect a
    new dataset of face images that involve these issues such as weather-based
    degradations, motion blur, focus blur and several others. We demonstrate
    that there is a considerable gap in the performance of state-of-the-art
    detectors and real-world requirements. Hence, in an attempt to fuel further
    research in unconstrained face detection, we present a new annotated
    Unconstrained Face Detection Dataset (UFDD) with several challenges and
    benchmark recent methods. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of
    the results and failure cases of these methods. The UFDD dataset as well as
    baseline results, evaluation code and image source are available at:
    www.ufdd.info/.

    We present a neural network-based upright frontal face detection system. A
    retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and
    decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between
    multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We present a
    straightforward procedure for aligning positive face examples for training.
    To collect negative examples, we use a bootstrap algorithm, which adds false
    detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the
    difficult task of manually selecting nonface training examples, which must
    be chosen to span the entire space of nonface images. Simple heuristics,
    such as using the fact that faces rarely overlap in images, can further
    improve the accuracy. Comparisons with several other state-of-the-art face
    detection systems are presented, showing that our system has comparable
    performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates.

    Computer Vision has recently witnessed great research advance towards
    automatic facial points detection. Numerous methodologies have been proposed
    during the last few years that achieve accurate and efficient performance.
    However, fair comparison between these methodologies is infeasible mainly
    due to two issues. (a) Most existing databases, captured under both
    constrained and unconstrained (in-the-wild) conditions have been annotated
    using different mark-ups and, in most cases, the accuracy of the annotations
    is low. (b) Most published works report experimental results using different
    training/testing sets, different error metrics and, of course, landmark
    points with semantically different locations. In this paper, we aim to
    overcome the aforementioned problems by (a) proposing a semi-automatic
    annotation technique that was employed to re-annotate most existing facial
    databases under a unified protocol, and (b) presenting the 300 Faces
    In-The-Wild Challenge (300-W), the first facial landmark localization
    challenge that was organized twice, in 2013 and 2015. To the best of our
    knowledge, this is the first effort towards a unified annotation scheme of
    massive databases and a fair experimental comparison of existing facial
    landmark localization systems. The images and annotations of the new testing
    database that was used in the 300-W challenge are available from
    http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/300-W_IMAVIS/.

    Developing powerful deformable face models requires massive, annotated face
    databases on which techniques can be trained, validated and tested. Manual
    annotation of each facial image in terms of landmarks requires a trained
    expert and the workload is usually enormous. Fatigue is one of the reasons
    that in some cases annotations are inaccurate. This is why, the majority of
    existing facial databases provide annotations for a relatively small subset
    of the training images. Furthermore, there is hardly any correspondence
    between the annotated land-marks across different databases. These problems
    make cross-database experiments almost infeasible. To overcome these
    difficulties, we propose a semi-automatic annotation methodology for
    annotating massive face datasets. This is the first attempt to create a tool
    suitable for annotating massive facial databases. We employed our tool for
    creating annotations for MultiPIE, XM2VTS, AR, and FRGC Ver. 2 databases.
    The annotations will be made publicly available from
    http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/ resources/facial-point-annotations/. Finally, we
    present experiments which verify the accuracy of produced annotations.

  abstract: >-
    Automatic facial point detection plays arguably the most important role in
    face analysis. Several methods have been proposed which reported their
    results on databases of both constrained and unconstrained conditions. Most
    of these databases provide annotations with different mark-ups and in some
    cases the are problems related to the accuracy of the fiducial points. The
    aforementioned issues as well as the lack of a evaluation protocol makes it
    difficult to compare performance between different systems. In this paper,
    we present the 300 Faces in-the-Wild Challenge: The first facial landmark
    localization Challenge which is held in conjunction with the International
    Conference on Computer Vision 2013, Sydney, Australia. The main goal of this
    challenge is to compare the performance of different methods on a
    new-collected dataset using the same evaluation protocol and the same
    mark-up and hence to develop the first standardized benchmark for facial
    landmark localization.

    Deformable model fitting has been actively pursued in the computer vision
    community for over a decade. As a result, numerous approaches have been
    proposed with varying degrees of success. A class of approaches that has
    shown substantial promise is one that makes independent predictions
    regarding locations of the model’s landmarks, which are combined by
    enforcing a prior over their joint motion. A common theme in innovations to
    this approach is the replacement of the distribution of probable landmark
    locations, obtained from each local detector, with simpler parametric forms.
    In this work, a principled optimization strategy is proposed where
    nonparametric representations of these likelihoods are maximized within a
    hierarchy of smoothed estimates. The resulting update equations are
    reminiscent of mean-shift over the landmarks but with regularization imposed
    through a global prior over their joint motion. Extensions to handle partial
    occlusions and reduce computational complexity are also presented. Through
    numerical experiments, this approach is shown to outperform some common
    existing methods on the task of generic face fitting.

    This report provides an analysis of 37 annotated frontal face images. All
    results presented have been obtained using our freely available Active
    Appearance Model (AAM) implementation. To ensure the reproducibility of the
    presented experiments, the data set has also been made available. As such,
    the data and this report may serve as a point of reference to compare other
    AAM implementations against. In addition, we address the problem of AAM
    model truncation using parallel analysis along with a comparable study of
    the two prevalent AAM learning methods; principal component regression and
    estimation of ﬁxed Jacobian matrices. To assess applicability and eﬃciency,
    timings for model building, warping and optimisation are given together with
    a description of how to exploit the warping capabilities of contemporary
    consumer-level graphics hardware.

    In modern face recognition, the conventional pipeline consists of four
    stages: detect => align => represent => classify. We revisit both the
    alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face
    modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a
    face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network. This deep network
    involves more than 120 million parameters using several locally connected
    layers without weight sharing, rather than the standard convolutional
    layers. Thus we trained it on the largest facial dataset to-date, an
    identity labeled dataset of four million facial images belonging to more
    than 4, 000 identities. The learned representations coupling the accurate
    model-based alignment with the large facial database generalize remarkably
    well to faces in unconstrained environments, even with a simple classifier.
    Our method reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild
    (LFW) dataset, reducing the error of the current state of the art by more
    than 27%, closely approaching human-level performance.

    We describe a very simple framework for deriving the most-well known
    optimization problems in Active Appearance Models (AAMs), and most
    importantly for providing efﬁcient solutions. Our formulation results in two
    optimization problems for fast and exact AAM ﬁtting, and one new algorithm
    which has the important advantage of being applicable to 3D. We show that
    the dominant cost for both forward and inverse algorithms is a few times mN
    which is the cost of projecting an image onto the appearance subspace. This
    makes both algorithms not only computationally realizable but also very
    attractive speed-wise for most current systems. Because exact AAM ﬁtting is
    no longer computationally prohibitive, we trained AAMs in-the-wild with the
    goal of investigating whether AAMs beneﬁt from such a training process. Our
    results show that although we did not use sophisticated shape priors, robust
    features or robust norms for improving performance, AAMs perform notably
    well and in some cases comparably with current state-ofthe-art methods. We
    provide Matlab source code for training, ﬁtting and reproducing the results
    presented in this paper at http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources.

    This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection
    which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high
    detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The
    ﬁrst is the introduction of a new image representation called the “Integral
    Image” which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very
    quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which
    selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and
    yields extremely efﬁcient classiﬁers[6]. The third contribution is a method
    for combining increasingly more complex classiﬁers in a “cascade” which
    allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while
    spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can
    be viewed as an object speciﬁc focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike
    previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions
    are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face
    detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous
    systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per
    second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.

    The locations of the fiducial facial landmark points around facial
    components and facial contour capture the rigid and non-rigid facial
    deformations due to head movements and facial expressions. They are hence
    important for various facial analysis tasks. Many facial landmark detection
    algorithms have been developed to automatically detect those key points over
    the years, and in this paper, we perform an extensive review of them. We
    classify the facial landmark detection algorithms into three major
    categories: holistic methods, Constrained Local Model (CLM) methods, and the
    regression-based methods. They differ in the ways to utilize the facial
    appearance and shape information. The holistic methods explicitly build
    models to represent the global facial appearance and shape information. The
    CLMs explicitly leverage the global shape model but build the local
    appearance models. The regression based methods implicitly capture facial
    shape and appearance information. For algorithms within each category, we
    discuss their underlying theories as well as their differences. We also
    compare their performances on both controlled and in the wild benchmark
    datasets, under varying facial expressions, head poses, and occlusion. Based
    on the evaluations, we point out their respective strengths and weaknesses.
    There is also a separate section to review the latest deep learning based
    algorithms. The survey also includes a listing of the benchmark databases
    and existing software. Finally, we identify future research directions,
    including combining methods in different categories to leverage their
    respective strengths to solve landmark detection “in-the-wild”.

    Many computer vision problems (e.g., camera calibration, image alignment,
    structure from motion) are solved through a nonlinear optimization method.
    It is generally accepted that 2nd order descent methods are the most robust,
    fast and reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization of a general smooth
    function. However, in the context of computer vision, 2nd order descent
    methods have two main drawbacks: (1) The function might not be analytically
    differentiable and numerical approximations are impractical. (2) The Hessian
    might be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, this
    paper proposes a Supervised Descent Method (SDM) for minimizing a Non-linear
    Least Squares (NLS) function. During training, the SDM learns a sequence of
    descent directions that minimizes the mean of NLS functions sampled at
    different points. In testing, SDM minimizes the NLS objective using the
    learned descent directions without computing the Jacobian nor the Hessian.
    We illustrate the benefits of our approach in synthetic and real examples,
    and show how SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the problem of
    facial feature detection. The code is available at www.humansensing.cs.

    In this paper, we present the details of our method in attending the 300
    Faces in-the-wild (300W) challenge. We build our method on cascade
    regression framework, where a series of regressors are utilized to
    progressively reﬁne the shape initialized by face detector. In cascade
    regression, we use the HOG feature in a multi-scale manner, where the large
    pose validation is handled in early stages by HOG feature at large scale,
    and then shape is reﬁned at later stages with HOG feature at small scale. We
    observe that the performance of the cascade regression method decreases when
    the initialization provided by face detector is not accurate enough (for
    faces with large appearance variations, face detection is still a
    challenging problem). To handle the problem, we propose to generate multiple
    hypotheses, and then learn to rank or combine these hypotheses to get the
    ﬁnal result. The parameters in both learn to rank and learn to combine can
    be learned in a structural SVM framework. Despite the simplicity of our
    method, it achieves state-ofthe-art performance on LFPW, and dramatically
    outperforms the baseline AAM on the 300-W challenge.

    Constrained Local Models (CLMs) are a well-established family of methods for
    facial landmark detection. However, they have recently fallen out of favor
    to cascaded regressionbased approaches. This is in part due to the inability
    of existing CLM local detectors to model the very complex individual
    landmark appearance that is affected by expression, illumination, facial
    hair, makeup, and accessories. In our work, we present a novel local
    detector – Convolutional Experts Network (CEN) – that brings together the
    advantages of neural architectures and mixtures of experts in an end-toend
    framework. We further propose a Convolutional Experts Constrained Local
    Model (CE-CLM) algorithm that uses CEN as a local detector. We demonstrate
    that our proposed CE-CLM algorithm outperforms competitive state-of-the-art
    baselines for facial landmark detection by a large margin, especially on
    challenging proﬁle images.

    Face detection is one of the most studied topics in computer vision
    literature, not only because of the challenging nature of face as an object,
    but also due to the countless applications that require the application of
    face detection as a first step. During the past 15years, tremendous progress
    has been made due to the availability of data in unconstrained capture
    conditions (so-called ‘in-the-wild’) through the Internet, the effort made
    by the community to develop publicly available benchmarks, as well as the
    progress in the development of robust computer vision algorithms. In this
    paper, we survey the recent advances in real-world face detection
    techniques, beginning with the seminal Viola–Jones face detector
    methodology. These techniques are roughly categorized into two general
    schemes: rigid templates, learned mainly via boosting based methods or by
    the application of deep neural networks, and deformable models that describe
    the face by its parts. Representative methods will be described in detail,
    along with a few additional successful methods that we briefly go through at
    the end. Finally, we survey the main databases used for the evaluation of
    face detection algorithms and recent benchmarking efforts, and discuss the
    future of face detection.

    We present a new approach to localize extensive facial landmarks with a
    coarse-to-ﬁne convolutional network cascade. Deep convolutional neural
    networks (DCNN) have been successfully utilized in facial landmark
    localization for two-fold advantages: 1) geometric constraints among facial
    points are implicitly utilized; 2) huge amount of training data can be
    leveraged. However, in the task of extensive facial landmark localization, a
    large number of facial landmarks (more than 50 points) are required to be
    located in a uniﬁed system, which poses great difﬁculty in the structure
    design and training process of traditional convolutional networks. In this
    paper, we design a four-level convolutional network cascade, which tackles
    the problem in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner. In our system, each network level is
    trained to locally reﬁne a subset of facial landmarks generated by previous
    network levels. In addition, each level predicts explicit geometric
    constraints (the position and rotation angles of a speciﬁc facial component)
    to rectify the inputs of the current network level. The combination of
    coarse-to-ﬁne cascade and geometric reﬁnement enables our system to locate
    extensive facial landmarks (68 points) accurately in the 300-W facial
    landmark localization challenge.

    We present a unified model for face detection, pose estimation, and landmark
    estimation in real-world, cluttered images. Our model is based on a mixtures
    of trees with a shared pool of parts; we model every facial landmark as a
    part and use global mixtures to capture topological changes due to
    viewpoint. We show that tree-structured models are surprisingly effective at
    capturing global elastic deformation, while being easy to optimize unlike
    dense graph structures. We present extensive results on standard face
    benchmarks, as well as a new “in the wild” annotated dataset, that suggests
    our system advances the state-of-the-art, sometimes considerably, for all
    three tasks. Though our model is modestly trained with hundreds of faces, it
    compares favorably to commercial systems trained with billions of examples
    (such as Google Picasa and face.com).

    Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in
    computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Its
    development in the past two decades can be regarded as an epitome of
    computer vision history. If we think of today's object detection as a
    technical aesthetics under the power of deep learning, then turning back the
    clock 20 years we would witness the wisdom of cold weapon era. This paper
    extensively reviews 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its
    technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s
    to 2019). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the
    milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental
    building blocks of the detection system, speed up techniques, and the recent
    state of the art detection methods. This paper also reviews some important
    detection applications, such as pedestrian detection, face detection, text
    detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis of their challenges as well as
    technical improvements in recent years.
